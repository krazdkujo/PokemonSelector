# Contracts: Vercel-Inspired UI Redesign

**Feature**: 015-vercel-ui-redesign
**Date**: 2026-01-12

## Overview

This feature involves **no API changes**. The UI redesign is purely visual and does not modify any API contracts, endpoints, or response formats.

## What This Directory Would Contain

For features that involve API changes, this directory would contain:
- OpenAPI specifications
- GraphQL schemas
- Request/response type definitions

## Why No Contracts Here

The Vercel-Inspired UI Redesign is a **frontend-only** feature that:
1. Does not add, modify, or remove any API endpoints
2. Does not change any data structures or response formats
3. Only modifies CSS, Tailwind configuration, and React component markup
4. Preserves all existing functionality

## Related Design Artifacts

Instead of API contracts, this feature's design artifacts include:
- `data-model.md` - Design token definitions
- `research.md` - Technology decisions and rationale
- `quickstart.md` - Implementation guide

These define the "contract" for the visual system - the tokens and patterns that components must adhere to.
